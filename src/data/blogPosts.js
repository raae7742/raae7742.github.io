    description: "MMR, A High-Availability Database Solution",
    content: ` In modern database systems, **high availability (HA)** and **fault tolerance** are crucial for ensuring continuous operations without data loss or downtime. **Multi-Master Replication (MMR)** is a database replication strategy designed to address these concerns by allowing multiple database nodes to function as masters, each capable of handling read and write operations.

This contrasts with **Single Master Replication (SMR)**, where only one node serves as the primary master while others act as replicas, limiting write operations to a single source. In MMR, updates made to any master node are **asynchronously propagated** to other master nodes, ensuring consistency while distributing workloads efficiently.

<br>

## Single Master Replication (SMR) vs. Multi-Master Replication (MMR)

### Single Master Replication (SMR)

- Write operations (**Create, Update, Delete - CUD**) occur on a designated primary database.
- Changes are replicated to one or more secondary databases.
- Replicated tables on secondary databases are typically read-only.
- Simpler to manage but presents a **single point of failure (SPoF)** for write operations.

### Multi-Master Replication (MMR)

- Two or more databases act as **equally privileged masters**.
- Each master database can perform read and write operations independently.
- Updates made to one master are replicated to all other masters asynchronously.
- Provides **fault tolerance** and **load distribution**, but requires conflict resolution mechanisms.

<br>

---

## Key Characteristics

1. **No Single Point of Failure (SPoF)**: Unlike SMR, where a primary master can become a bottleneck, MMR eliminates this dependency.
2. **Distributed Write Capability**: Multiple nodes can handle concurrent write operations, reducing the load on any single node.
3. **Eventual Consistency**: Due to asynchronous replication, updates might take time to propagate, leading to temporary inconsistencies.
4. **Read Scalability**: Each master node can have read replicas, further improving system performance.
5. **Geographical Data Distribution**: Reduces latency by placing master nodes closer to users in different regions.
6. **Use Cases with Decentralized Data Management**: Applications like **Google Drive**, **Notion**, and other collaborative platforms benefit from MMR by enabling real-time multi-user access and synchronization.

<br>

## Replication Process

1. A write operation occurs on **any master node**.
2. The update is **asynchronously** transmitted to all other master nodes.
3. Each master applies the update to maintain consistency.
4. If two masters modify the same data simultaneously, a **conflict resolution mechanism** is needed.

<br>

## Challenges and Considerations

### 1. Conflict Resolution

- If two masters update the same record simultaneously, conflicts must be resolved via timestamp-based precedence, **last-write-wins**, or **custom application logic**.

### 2. Latency & Network Overhead

- Cross-region replication can introduce delays due to network bandwidth limitations.
- Ensuring low-latency communication between master nodes is critical.

### 3. Data Consistency

- Since replication is asynchronous, data may be temporarily inconsistent across different master nodes.
- Strong consistency mechanisms can be implemented at the cost of performance.

### 4. Increased Complexity

- Managing multiple master nodes requires robust **synchronization, monitoring, and failover mechanisms**.
- Tools like **Galera Cluster for MySQL**, **CouchDB**, and **Google Spanner** offer built-in multi-master replication support.

# Conclusion

Multi-Master Replication provides a **powerful solution for distributed databases**, ensuring high availability, load balancing, and resilience. However, it comes with **trade-offs**, such as potential conflicts, network overhead, and increased system complexity. Choosing MMR should be based on **application needs**, expected traffic patterns, and the ability to manage potential challenges effectively.`,

    title: "Understanding Load Balancers",
    date: "29 Oct 2024",
    description: "L4 and L7 Switches",
    content: ` In modern distributed systems, managing incoming network traffic efficiently is crucial to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and availability. This is where **Load Balancers** come into play. A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers. This helps prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck, thereby improving responsiveness and fault tolerance. Load balancers are especially important when **scaling out** applications, allowing infrastructure to handle increasing loads dynamically.

# **L4 vs. L7 Load Balancers: An Overview**

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** defines different layers of networking. Load balancers operate at different layers of this model, most commonly at **Layer 4 (L4)** and **Layer 7 (L7)**.

<br>

## **Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancing ( = L4 Switch)**

An **L4 Load Balancer** operates at the **transport layer**, making forwarding decisions based on IP addresses and port numbers without inspecting the actual content of the network packets. This approach is more efficient as it does not require deep packet inspection.

Popular L4 load balancers include **AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)** and other hardware-based solutions.

<br>

## **Key Functions of L4 Load Balancers**

### 1. **Traffic Distribution**

- Uses various algorithms for load balancing:
    - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially.
    - **Least Connection**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
    - **Ratio-based**: Routes traffic based on predefined server weights.
    - **Fastest Response Time**: Selects the server with the lowest latency.

### 2. **Source/Destination IP NAT (Network Address Translation)**

- Helps mitigate **DDoS attacks** using SYN cookie protection.

### 3. **TCP Connection Management**

- Manages **3-way handshake** between client and server.
- Tracks active connections and terminates unused ones after a timeout.

### 4. **SSL Offloading**

- Decrypts **SSL/TLS traffic** from the client before forwarding it to backend servers as plain text.

### 5. **Health Checks**

- Periodically checks backend servers to ensure they are functional.
- Supports TCP and HTTP-based health checks.

### 6. **Persistence (Sticky Sessions)**

- Ensures clients consistently connect to the same backend server when necessary.

<br>

## **L4 Load Balancer Deployment Models**

### 1. In-Line Architecture

- All traffic must pass through the L4 switch.
- Advantages: Easier to monitor traffic and diagnose issues.
- Disadvantages: Increased load on the L4 switch, requiring redundancy solutions.
- **(TODO draw a diagram)** Internet - Backbone Switch - L4 Switch - L2 Switch - Servers.

### **2. One-Arm Architecture**

- L4 switch operates alongside the backbone switch.
- Advantages: Reduces the load on L4 and ensures continued connectivity if L4 fails.
- Disadvantages: Some traffic bypasses L4, making troubleshooting harder.
- **(TODO draw a diagram)** Internet → Backbone Switch → L4 → Backbone Switch → L2 → Servers.

### 3. Direct Server Return(DSR)

- The L4 switch handles incoming traffic, but the server directly responds to clients.
- Commonly used for performance optimization.

<br>

## **L7 Load Balancing: A Deeper Look ( = L7 Switching)**

An **L7 Load Balancer** operates at the **application layer**, making forwarding decisions based on HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, or even request payloads. This enables **content-based routing** and supports advanced traffic management strategies.

A common example is the **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, which offers more flexibility for web applications.

<br>

### **How L7 Load Balancers Work**

- Inspects HTTP headers and other metadata to direct traffic.
- Can differentiate between **mobile and desktop clients** for customized responses.
- Supports **path-based routing**, allowing different URLs to be handled by different backend servers.

<br>

### **Why Use L4 vs. L7 Load Balancing?**

- L4 is **faster and more efficient** because it does not inspect content.
- L7 is **more flexible** and supports **advanced traffic routing**.
- If HTTP header inspection is unnecessary, using L4 saves computational resources.
- In contrast, L7 is preferred when deep traffic analysis or content-based routing is needed.

# Load Balancing in Kubernetes

 Kubernetes provides built-in service types to manage traffic within a cluster. The three primary types are:

1. **ClusterIP**
    - Default service type, accessible only within the cluster.
2. **NodePort**
    - Exposes the service on a static port across all nodes.
3. **LoadBalancer**
    - Integrates with external load balancers (such as AWS ELB or GCP Load Balancer) for external traffic distribution.

# Kafka and Rebalancing

Kafka, a distributed messaging system, also involves load balancing in the form of **partition rebalancing**. This ensures that message consumption is evenly distributed among consumers when new nodes join or leave the cluster.`,
