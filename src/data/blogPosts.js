    title: "Understanding Multi-Master Replication",
    date: "3 Nov 2024",
    description: "MMR, A High-Availability Database Solution",
    content: ` In modern database systems, **high availability (HA)** and **fault tolerance** are crucial for ensuring continuous operations without data loss or downtime. **Multi-Master Replication (MMR)** is a database replication strategy designed to address these concerns by allowing multiple database nodes to function as masters, each capable of handling read and write operations.

This contrasts with **Single Master Replication (SMR)**, where only one node serves as the primary master while others act as replicas, limiting write operations to a single source. In MMR, updates made to any master node are **asynchronously propagated** to other master nodes, ensuring consistency while distributing workloads efficiently.

<br>

## Single Master Replication (SMR) vs. Multi-Master Replication (MMR)

### Single Master Replication (SMR)

- Write operations (**Create, Update, Delete - CUD**) occur on a designated primary database.
- Changes are replicated to one or more secondary databases.
- Replicated tables on secondary databases are typically read-only.
- Simpler to manage but presents a **single point of failure (SPoF)** for write operations.

### Multi-Master Replication (MMR)

- Two or more databases act as **equally privileged masters**.
- Each master database can perform read and write operations independently.
- Updates made to one master are replicated to all other masters asynchronously.
- Provides **fault tolerance** and **load distribution**, but requires conflict resolution mechanisms.

<br>

---

## Key Characteristics

1. **No Single Point of Failure (SPoF)**: Unlike SMR, where a primary master can become a bottleneck, MMR eliminates this dependency.
2. **Distributed Write Capability**: Multiple nodes can handle concurrent write operations, reducing the load on any single node.
3. **Eventual Consistency**: Due to asynchronous replication, updates might take time to propagate, leading to temporary inconsistencies.
4. **Read Scalability**: Each master node can have read replicas, further improving system performance.
5. **Geographical Data Distribution**: Reduces latency by placing master nodes closer to users in different regions.
6. **Use Cases with Decentralized Data Management**: Applications like **Google Drive**, **Notion**, and other collaborative platforms benefit from MMR by enabling real-time multi-user access and synchronization.

<br>

## Replication Process

1. A write operation occurs on **any master node**.
2. The update is **asynchronously** transmitted to all other master nodes.
3. Each master applies the update to maintain consistency.
4. If two masters modify the same data simultaneously, a **conflict resolution mechanism** is needed.

<br>

## Challenges and Considerations

### 1. Conflict Resolution

- If two masters update the same record simultaneously, conflicts must be resolved via timestamp-based precedence, **last-write-wins**, or **custom application logic**.

### 2. Latency & Network Overhead

- Cross-region replication can introduce delays due to network bandwidth limitations.
- Ensuring low-latency communication between master nodes is critical.

### 3. Data Consistency

- Since replication is asynchronous, data may be temporarily inconsistent across different master nodes.
- Strong consistency mechanisms can be implemented at the cost of performance.

### 4. Increased Complexity

- Managing multiple master nodes requires robust **synchronization, monitoring, and failover mechanisms**.
- Tools like **Galera Cluster for MySQL**, **CouchDB**, and **Google Spanner** offer built-in multi-master replication support.

# Conclusion

Multi-Master Replication provides a **powerful solution for distributed databases**, ensuring high availability, load balancing, and resilience. However, it comes with **trade-offs**, such as potential conflicts, network overhead, and increased system complexity. Choosing MMR should be based on **application needs**, expected traffic patterns, and the ability to manage potential challenges effectively.`,

    title: "Load Balancers: The Ticket Machine for Your Website Traffic",
    date: "29 Oct 2024",
    description: "Distribute traffic efficiently, from L4 to L7",
    content: ` Imagine all the people visiting your website are like customers walking into a bank.

Now, if the bank just says, *‚ÄúHey everyone, line up over here!‚Äù* what happens?
Everyone crowds into one poor teller‚Äôs line, while the other tellers sit back sipping coffee. That‚Äôs exactly what happens when all traffic goes to a single server‚Äîit gets overloaded while others do nothing.

This is why banks have **a ticket machine**.
You grab a ticket, and the machine assigns you to whichever teller is free. No chaos, no unfair workload. Customers are happy, and tellers don‚Äôt burn out.

In the world of IT, this magical ticket machine is the **Load Balancer**.

* \`Customers\` = user requests

* \`Tellers\` = servers

* \`Ticket machine\` = load balancer

But here‚Äôs the fun part:

When the bank suddenly gets flooded with customers, the manager can secretly bring in a few more tellers. Customers don‚Äôt even notice‚Äîthey just keep taking tickets and getting served.

That‚Äôs exactly how scaling out works in modern systems. Add more servers, let the load balancer distribute the work, and everyone‚Äôs happy: customers, servers, and the system administrators. üéâ

# L4 vs. L7 Load Balancers: The Big Picture

Before we dive into comparing L4 and L7 load balancers, let‚Äôs talk about **the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model**.

<img src="/img/osi_layer.png" alt="OsiLayer" width="100%" />

It sounds intimidating, but really, it‚Äôs just a fancy way of saying: *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the seven-step recipe for how data travels across the internet.‚Äù*

Think of it like a package delivery service:

- Which country it‚Äôs coming from (\`Layer 1‚Äì2: Physical/Data Link\`)

- Which city or neighborhood it‚Äôs heading to (\`Layer 3: Network\`)

- Which apartment door to knock on (\`Layer 4: Transport\`)

- And finally, opening the door to check who the package is really for (\`Layer 7: Application\`)

Step by step, the package makes its way safely to the right person.

Now, here‚Äôs where load balancers come in. They can work at **Layer 4 or Layer 7**:

- An **L4 switch** is like a courier who only looks at the address and apartment number‚Äîfast, but doesn‚Äôt care what‚Äôs inside the box.

- An **L7 switch** is like a courier who actually opens the box to see if it‚Äôs pizza, fried chicken, or a love letter before deciding where to deliver it.

So, **L4 is quick and simple**, while **L7 is smarter and more precise**‚Äîbut might take a little longer.


<br>

## Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancer: The Courier Who Only Looks at the Address

An **L4 Load Balancer** operates at the **transport layer**, making forwarding decisions based on IP addresses and port numbers without inspecting the actual content of the network packets. This approach is more efficient as it does not require deep packet inspection.

They don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs inside the box at all.

Instead, they just say:

*‚ÄúOh, this package is going to \`192.168.0.10\` (= IP address) + \`:443\` (= Port number).‚Äù* ‚Üí \`Delivered!\`

Since they never open the box (no deep inspection), everything goes much faster and more efficiently.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Functions of L4 Load Balancers

### 1. Traffic Distribution Algorithms
  - **Round Robin**: Distributes packages sequentially.
  - **Least Connection**: Chooses the least busy server.
  - **Ratio-based**: Some servers get more, some get less‚Äîbased on weight.
  - **Fastest Response Time**: Sends traffic to the server that replies the quickest.

### 2. Source/Destination IP NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - The courier can relabel the package with a different address.
  - This trick also helps defend against DDoS attacks (like preventing a delivery riot).

### 3. TCP Connection Management
  - Manages the classic **3-way handshake**: between client and server.
    - *‚ÄúKnock knock.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúOkay, come in.‚Äù*
  - Tracks active connections and cleans up unused ones after a timeout.

### 4. SSL Offloading
  - The courier decrypts the package before passing it on.
  - The server then receives it as plain text, saving effort and working faster.

### 5. Health Checks
  - Keeps checking if a server is ‚Äúalive.‚Äù
  - If one server is down, no packages go there.

### 6. Sticky Sessions
  - Ensures clients consistently connect to the same backend server when necessary.

<br>

## Layer 7 (L7) Load Balancer: The Courier Who Opens the Box

If L4 was the courier who only looks at the address and apartment number, L7 is the more curious type. This courier actually opens the package and checks what‚Äôs inside before deciding where to send it.

In networking terms, an L7 load balancer operates at the application layer. Instead of just looking at IP and port, it inspects HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and even request payloads. That means it can make smarter, content-based decisions.

<br>

### üõ†Ô∏è How L7 Load Balancers Work

**1. Content Inspection**
  - Checks the label, the note inside, or even peeks into the box (= HTTP headers, cookies, payload).
  - Example: *‚ÄúOh, this request is for \`/images\`, send it to the image server. This one‚Äôs for \`/api\`, send it to the API server.‚Äù*

**2. User Awareness**
  - Can tell if the client is mobile or desktop, and route accordingly.
  - Example: *‚ÄúThis package is for Android users, forward to the mobile-optimized service!‚Äù*

**3. Path-based Routing**
  - Different URLs = different backend servers.
  - \`/login\` ‚Üí Authentication server, \`/products\` ‚Üí Catalog server, \`/checkout\` ‚Üí Payment server.

<br>

### L4 vs. L7: Which Courier Do You Need?
- **L4 (Address-only courier):**
  - Fast, efficient, doesn‚Äôt waste time opening boxes. Perfect if you don‚Äôt care about what‚Äôs inside.

- **L7 (Curious courier):**
  - Slower, because opening boxes takes time, but way more flexible. Great for content-based routing and advanced strategies.

> üëâ If you don‚Äôt need deep inspection, L4 saves resources.

> üëâ If you need smarter decisions based on content, L7 is the way to go.

## üöÄ Load Balancing in Real Systems: Kubernetes & Kafka

Think of load balancers in a real system as **the couriers who decide where and how to deliver packages.**

They determine which counter, which route, and which server should get the traffic‚Äîjust like a courier managing parcels.


### Load Balancing in Kubernetes

Kubernetes provides service types to manage traffic within a cluster.

It‚Äôs like setting rules for how packages should be delivered inside a company.

1. **ClusterIP**
  - Accessible only within the cluster.
  - Like a *‚Äúcompany-internal delivery desk‚Äù* that external customers cannot use.

2. **NodePort**
  - Exposes the service on the same port across all nodes.
  - Like having *‚Äúdelivery windows at all company entrances‚Äù* so anyone can drop off or pick up.

3. **LoadBalancer**
  - Integrates with external load balancers (AWS ELB, GCP Load Balancer, etc.).
  - Like *distributing incoming traffic (packages) evenly across multiple servers (couriers).*

In short, Kubernetes defines rules for how L4/L7 couriers deliver the packages inside the cluster.

<br>

### Kafka and Partition Rebalancing

Kafka, a distributed messaging system, also uses load balancing to deliver messages (packages) evenly across consumers (couriers).

- When a new consumer joins or leaves, Kafka performs partition rebalancing.

- Think of it like: *‚ÄúA new courier joins, let‚Äôs redistribute the packages fairly so no one is overloaded.‚Äù*

- This ensures all consumers get a balanced workload.

# Conclusion

### L4 Load Balancer
- Operates at the transport layer, forwarding traffic based solely on IP addresses and port numbers. It is fast, efficient, and suitable for handling high-volume traffic, where simple distribution is sufficient.

### L7 Load Balancer
- Operates at the application layer, inspecting HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and request payloads. It enables intelligent routing, content-based decisions, and customized responses, making it ideal for complex traffic management scenarios.

### Practical Applications (Kubernetes & Kafka)
Load balancers are critical in modern distributed systems. In Kubernetes, they distribute incoming requests across services efficiently, while in Kafka, partition rebalancing ensures even distribution of messages among consumers. Proper use of L4 and L7 load balancing is essential for **scalability, reliability, and performance optimization.**

> **Key takeaway:** Choose L4 for high-speed, simple traffic distribution, and L7 when content-aware routing or advanced traffic management is required.
